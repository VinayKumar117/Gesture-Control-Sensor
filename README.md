# Gesture-Control-Sensor
Control world with a wave of your hand

Hand gesture control is a project that involves UV-light sensors to detect hand gestures and control devices
The basic idea behind this project is to use the UV sensors to detect changes in
the amount of UV light reflected from a personâ€™s hand as they make different gestures. The information collected
by the UV sensors is then processed by an Arduino microcontroller to interpret the gestures and control various
devices or systems.
